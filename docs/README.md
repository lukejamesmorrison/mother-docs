::: warning
Mother is in beta development. I'm on a quest to reduce the character count, and increase the functionality. Please report any issues you encounter, and expect some of the commands and underlying framework to change.

    <h2>Mother OS</h2>
    <p>Ingame Script for Space Engineers players</p>
    <p>Mother is a general purpose operating system for Space Engineers grids available as an in-game script. It exposes an intuitive command line interface (CLI), flexible flight control & planning, and an intergrid communication system to massively expand what you can do with your grid(s). I built Mother to make my ships operate more like spaceships on a network, rather than just a collection of blocks flying through space. With Mother's CLI, most common operations can easily be assigned to a button without needing a Timer or Event Block.</p>
    <p>You do not need any programming experience to use Mother.  In fact, most of Mother's CLI commands offer a more intutive control mechanism than the base game itself. However, if you fancy yourself a programmer, you can easily extend Mother's functionality by creating a custom project. Mother is built on top of <a href="https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE" target=_blank>MDK-SE</a>, thanks to the incredible contributions **Malware** has made to the Space Engineers community.  I hope you enjoy using Mother as much as I enjoyed building it.</p>

## Mother Core

Script Framework for custom Space Engineers ingame scripts.

<!-- [Get Started](./Framework/README.md) | [MDK-SE API Index](https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE/wiki) -->

::: warning
Mother Core is coming soon as a downloadable script framework for Space Engineers written in C#6. It depends on [MDK2](https://github.com/malforge/mdk2/wiki).  Stay tuned for updates!

##  About Agentluke
I have always been passionate about aviation and space. I studied Aerospace Engineering, and flew in fighter jets in the Air Force for over a decade. I have been writing software since university, and I have always been fascinated by the intersection of software and hardware.

I discovered Space Engineers several years ago after my brother had been playing it for some time. I was immediately hooked. Sandbox games and builders are my jam, and Space Engineers is an excellent space sandbox. I find the automation capabilties quite clunky and require a lot of menu navigation, but curiousity got the best of me as I explored what the programmable block could do!  

I built Mother to make my ships operate more like intelligent spaceships, rather than just a collection of blocks flying through space. This project has been a labor of love for about 18 months. I hope you enjoy using Mother as much as I enjoyed building it.

## Thanks

**Malware** has made done critical foundational work by building the [MDK-SE API Index](https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE/wiki) and [MDK2](https://github.com/malforge/mdk2/wiki). Without these tools, developing a framwork of this complexity would not have been possible. Cheers mate 🍻
