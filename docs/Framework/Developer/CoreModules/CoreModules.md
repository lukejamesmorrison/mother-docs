# Core Modules

Core modules act as Mother's operating framework. They enable extension modules, and simplify access to many capabilities you will reach for.

|Name											| Description|
|-												|-|
| [Activity Monitor](ActivityMonitor.md)    | Monitors functional block activity across cycles to enable safeguards like stopping and locking once the activity is complete.|
| [Almanac](Almanac.md)                     | Stores information about other grids running Mother including position and hostility.|
| [Block Catalogue](BlockCatalogue.md)      | Catalogues all functional blocks available on the grid for use in automations. |
| [Command Bus](CommandBus.md)				| Handles commands and routines executed by a player, or remotely from another grid. |
| [Configuration](Configuration.md) | Manages the configuration of Mother and its modules using the Programmable Block's `Custom Data`. |
| [Event Bus](EventBus.md) | Handles system events generated by the grid or other grids running Mother. This allows Mother to remain modular and only run when something has changed via event broadcasting. |
| [Intergrid Message Service](IntergridMessageService.md) | Handles communication between grids running Mother. |
| [Local Storage](LocalStorage.md) | Allows Mother to store information across cycles, even if an error occurs or a player hits `Recompile`. |
