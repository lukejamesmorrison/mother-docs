# Installation
## 1. Install MDK2

First you will need MDK2, and amazing developer kit that Malware has provided. You can easily download it [here](MDK2_LINK), and I highly recommend Visual Studio for developing scripts with Mother.

## 2. Clone Mother from Github / download from Nuget?

The first step is to download Mother locally.  You can do this with the following command in terminal:
```bash title="Terminal"
$> command-to-clone-mother
```

You can also create a new Mother project from Nuget:

NUGET STUFF

::: note
This framework does not include all modules shipped with the  [Mother OS]() in game script.  You may however access the source code for Mother OS [here]() to assist with building your own modules.

## 3. Build

You now have everything you need to get started.  To get started quickly, check out [Creating a Custom Module](#creating-a-custom-module).  

Otherwise, use `Ctrl + B` to build your script. The build tool should automatically save your script into the appropriate directory, for access in game.

## 4. Play
When playing Space Engineers, your script should be available via the in game `Edit` menu on a Programmable Block.
