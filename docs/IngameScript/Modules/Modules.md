# Modules


Mother comes with many functional modules. These modules can be categorized as [Core](#core-modules) Modules and [Extension](#extension-modules) Modules.

## Core Modules

Core modules act as Mother's framework, enabling extension modules.

|Name											| Description|
|-												|-|
| [Activity Monitor](Core/ActivityMonitor.md)    | Monitors functional block activity across cycles to enable safeguards like stopping and locking once the activity is complete.|
| [Almanac](Core/Almanac.md)                     | Stores information about other grids running Mother including position and hostility.|
| [Block Catalogue](Core/BlockCatalogue.md)      | Catalogues all functional blocks available on the grid for use in automations. |
| Command Bus				| Handles commands and routines executed by a player, or remotely from another grid. |
| [Configuration](../Configuration.md) | Manages the configuration of Mother and its modules using the Programmable Block's `Custom Data`. |
| Event Bus | Handles system events generated by the grid or other grids running Mother. This allows Mother to remain modular and only run when something has changed via event broadcasting. |
| [Intergrid Message Service](Core/IntergridMessageService.md) | Handles communication between grids running Mother. |
| [Local Storage](Core/LocalStorage.md) | Allows Mother to store information across cycles, even if an error occurs or a player hits `Recompile`. |
| Log | Logs information about the grid and Mother's activity. |
| [Security](Core/Security.md) | Responsible for encrypting messages and and other system data. |

## Extension Modules

Extension modules provide additional functionality to a Space Engineer for controlling their grid. They leverage the core modules to manage activity, and cooperate with other grids running Mother.  

### All Blocks

|Name													| Description|
|-														|-								|
| [Terminal Block](Extension/TerminalBlockModule.md)              | Manages terminal blocks on the grid. Commands in this module may be used on any block supported by Mother. |

### By Function
|Name													| Description|
|-														|-								|
| [FLight Planning](Extension/FlightPlanningModule.md)           | Provides navigation capabilities for the grid including dynamic flight planning.|
| [Flight Control](Extension/FlightControlModule.md)	| Manaages autopilot and flight characteristics.|
| [Docking](Extension/DockingModule.md)         | Manages docking procedures for the grid.|
