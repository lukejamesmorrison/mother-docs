# Modules

<!-- [< Configuration](../Configuration.md) -->

Mother comes with many functional modules. These modules can be categorized as [Core](#core-modules) Modules and [Extension](#extension-modules) Modules.

## Core Modules

Core modules act as Mother's framework, enabling extension modules.

|Name											| Description|
|-												|-|
| [Activity Monitor](Core/ActivityMonitor.md)    | Monitors functional block activity across cycles to enable safeguards like stopping and locking once the activity is complete.|
| [Almanac](Core/Almanac.md)                     | Stores information about other grids running Mother including position and hostility.|
| [Block Catalogue](Core/BlockCatalogue.md)      | Catalogues all functional blocks available on the grid for use in automations. |
| Command Bus				| Handles commands and routines executed by a player, or remotely from another grid. |
| [Configuration](../Configuration.md) | Manages the configuration of Mother and its modules using the Programmable Block's `CustomData`. |
| Display Manager | Manages the display of information on LCD panels and the Programmable Block terminal window. |
| Event Bus | Handles system events generated by the grid or other grids running Mother. This allows Mother to remain modular and only run when something has changed via event broadcasting. |
| Intergrid Message Service | Handles communication between grids running Mother. |
| [Local Storage](Core/LocalStorage.md) | Allows Mother to store information across cycles, even if an error occurs or a player hits `Recompile`. |
| Log | Logs information about the grid and Mother's activity. |
| [Security](Core/Security.md) | Responsible for encrypting messages and and other system data. |

## Extension Modules

Extension modules provide additional functionality to a Space Engineer for controlling their grid. They leverage the core modules to manage activity, and cooperate with other grids running Mother.  

|Name													| Description|
|-														|-								|
| [Terminal Block](Extension/BlockModule.md)              | Manages terminal blocks on the grid. Commands in this module may be used on any block supported by Mother. |
| [Communication](Extension/CommunicationModule.md)     | Enables communication between grids running Mother.|
| [Navigation](Extension/NavigationModule.md)           | Provides navigation capabilities for the grid including dynamic flight planning.|
| [Flight Control](Extension/FlightControlModule.md)	| Manaages autopilot and flight characteristics.|
| [Connectors](Extension/ConnectorModule.md)			| Manages connectors on the grid.|
| [Doors](Extension/DoorModule.md)						| Manages doors on the grid.|
| [Docking Module](Extension/DockingModule.md)         | Manages docking procedures for the grid.|
| [Hinges](Extension/HingeModule.md)					| Manages hinges on the grid.|
| [Rotors](Extension/RotorModule.md)					| Manages rotors on the grid.|
| [Pistons](Extension/PistonModule.md)					| Manages pistons on the grid.|
| [Lights](Extension/LightModule.md)                    | Manages lights on the grid.|
| [Thrusters](Extension/ThrusterModule.md)              | Manages thrusters on the grid.|
| [Gyroscopes](Extension/GyroscopeModule.md)				| Manages gyroscopes on the grid.|
| [Timer Blocks](Extension/TimerBlockModule.md)			| Manages timer blocks on the grid.|
| [Batteries](Extension/BatteryModule.md)					| Manages batteries on the grid.|
| [Gas Tanks](Extension/TankModule.md)					| Manages oxygen and hydrogen tanks on the grid.|
| [Sound Blocks](Extension/SoundModule.md)				| Manages sound blocks on the grid. |
| [Air Vents](Extension/AirVentModule.md)			| Manages air vents on the grid. |
| [Landing Gear](Extension/LandingGearModule.md) | Manages landing gear and magnetic plates on the grid.|
| [Sensors](Extension/SensorModule.md) | Manages sensors on the grid.|
