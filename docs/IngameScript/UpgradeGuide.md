## 0.2.12 -> 0.2.13
ðŸ•“ 0 mins

This update makes major changes to the boot process but does not require any changes to your existing scripts. 

Players can now use the `boot` command to run the Mother OS boot sequence. This is automatically run when the Programmable Block is started, but can be run manually to reset the system. 

Players can also increment and decrement inputs for various commands like `hinge/rotate` and `piston/distance` using the `add` and `sub` command options.
