# Installation

[[toc]]

## Prerequisites
Mother OS is available as a script for Programmable Blocks in Space Engineers. Simply [subscribe in the Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3411507973) and it will be available to you in-game.

**To run Mother OS, your grid must have:**

1. A programmable block with the [Mother OS script](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3411507973) loaded; and
2. A Remote Control block.

If you're comfortable with adding scripts in Space Engineers, then you can jump ahead to the [Command Line Interface (CLI)](CommandLineInterface.md).

## Setup

### 1. Find and Edit the Programmable Block script
Mother OS is loaded into a Programmable Block by selecting the `Edit` button in the terminal.

### 3. Confirm Mother OS is Loaded
Mother OS should be loaded into the Programmable Block. You will know this if you see the description at the top of the Code Editor. Press `Ok` to save the changes.

### 4. Verify that Mother OS     is Running
Mother OS should boot automatically when the script is loaded, otherwise running the `boot` command, or pressing the `Recompile` button will ensure Mother completes the boot process.I recommend you rename your Programmable Block to make it easier to identify - this will help later.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Mother OS into your grid. Now let's look at how you can use it to automate your grids.
