I studied Aerospace Engineering, and flew in fighter jets in the Air Force for over a decade. I have been writing software since university, and I have always been fascinated by the intersection of software and hardware.</p><p>I discovered Space Engineers several years ago after my brother had been playing it for some time. I was immediately hooked. Sandbox games and builders are my jam, and Space Engineers is an excellent space sandbox. I find the automation capabilties quite clunky and require a lot of menu navigation, but curiousity got the best of me as I explored what the programmable block could do!</p><p>I built Mother to make my ships operate more like intelligent spaceships, rather than just a collection of blocks flying through space. This project has been a labor of love for about 18 months. I hope you enjoy using Mother as much as I enjoyed building it.</p><p><strong>Luke</strong> - Space Engineer üöÄüá®üá¶</p><h2 id="thanks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#thanks"><span>Thanks</span></a></h2><p><strong>Malware</strong> has made done critical foundational work by building the <a href="https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE/wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MDK-SE API Index</a> and <a href="https://github.com/malforge/mdk2/wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MDK2</a>.
